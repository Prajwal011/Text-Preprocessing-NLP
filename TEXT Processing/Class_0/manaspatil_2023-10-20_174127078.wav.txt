Hello, how are you doing? I'm doing pretty good. How is everything going? It's going well in college. Overall. Before, it was fine for a few months.

0:00:14
Now, it's not going well.

0:00:16
Okay. So, you were a little over-excited in the beginning.

1
0:00:20
What happened? What difficulties did you face? No, it was normal. A little procrastination. I had exams, now I am on point. In October I decided that I will be on point. So you are focusing now.

Do you have an interest in this field?

1
0:00:40
Yes, I have. I had no idea in 11th. I was very sudden. It was a very quick decision. I had only two months to decide what to do. But now I am interested. What were your college best days?

0:01:03
Actually, I didn't want to give so many lectures.

I was in a club called Rocket Tree. I spend most of my time there or I spend time with my friends. Just as such, we are not there. So, you are in the robotics sector. Right. But we make sounding rockets. There is a competition in Brazil.

There are categories of 1 km, 3 km. So, we have to go there. You have to go there according to the trajectory. I have seen the whole trajectory of the project.

How was your position there?

Our rocket was launched well, but we had some issues in recovery. But overall, our ranks were good. We came 9th in the overall board and 4th in the category. Very good. What are your dreams for the future? I will probably go first, but I have decided that I will apply for MS, mostly in Germany.

1
0:02:06
So, I will have to fill the application forms now. What is the purpose of your life? What is your goal? I don't want to do something completely different. I want to live a happy life. I want to do what I like. And I want to have a good professional life. I can afford all this.

Luxuries. Have you ever had any disappointments or disheartening situations in your life? or any startling situations? Yes, it happened in 11th and 12th. In 10th and 12th it was like school. But in 11th and 12th,

1
0:02:51
everything started to become real. And then, in 11th and 12th, there was a lot of workload. Our class was a little different. Normally, classes were 3 hours,

1
0:03:03
we used to take tuitions. In 11th and 12th, it was 6 to 7 hours. 3 hours of teaching and 3 hours of solving. We had to sit down and solve. I felt that we didn't manage to do that. And the thing is, the portion was so large that at one point we felt that it's okay.

1
0:03:27
We solved as much as we needed. So, it was a bit disheartening. We felt that we weren't capable of doing that. But now, can you do all that? Yes, now we can do it in college. Because there is a portion for every semester.

1
0:03:41
And it is not all the same. Now it is possible.

2
0:03:45
How do you feel about the present scenario? How do you feel? In college...

1
0:03:50
Now, you are in the class. Oh, here?

5
0:03:53
Yes, it is good here.

1
0:03:54
I had to stop my car on the way. I had a lot of trouble. I had to leave my friend. I don't have any problems with that.
