How was your college?

1
0:00:06
I had a scene in the play, but I didn't get a detention. I got a sword. Did you feel any stress? I felt like I had done something wrong. How did you get a detention? I got attendance.

How many times did you study? 10% in Likshedkar You completed it in 3rd year? No, in 5th year I was preparing for placement for the competitive exams

0:00:36

How did you handle it? I was more of a wifey I have a brother who lives in Mumbai, he is an ARBI student. If I had a brother, I would have been able to handle everything. What do you think is the most stressful period and then you have to get a placement

1
0:01:18
so what do you need for a placement? you need a character if you have that in you, you will be successful even if you don't get a job, you will be successful because there are many boys who have good CGPA but still they don't get a placement

1

and those who have less CGPA, they get a placement. My personal view is that people who are not so famous, they have a doubt whether they are more famous in real life or not, whether they can compete with others or not. Maybe that is the dilemma. Because a confident person will never be as good as a smart person.

That's what I think so. So, personality development is very important. Yes, personality development. What do you want to learn from it? Body language. Your tone is very important while speaking.

It should be monotonous. I gave an interview once, I got a lot of feedback. I started well, but the tone was a bit low. So, this is a good insight, a good tone. For this, extracurricular activities are the best way, or you can develop your personality. So, are there any such provisions in our curriculum?

1
0:02:42
Yes, there are. The college organizes many events. They encourage you to participate. I have a lot of input in it. I don't have to take it personally. What have you done personally? I have performed on stage since childhood.

1
0:03:00
I have also danced. I have played cricket, football, badminton and handball. My school teacher used to say that I should try out a new sport. I played 3-4 sports well. I played cricket till state level and played all the sports till regional level. I was not aware of the vaccine.

1
0:03:29
I participated in the program and did it. I gave awareness and said, do it. And now, Odin's trip accident happened. At that time, I collected some money for this. I donated it. I did not get any input, but I did my best.

2
0:04:04
You just had to try.

1
0:04:06
Yes, I had to try.

2
0:04:07
You did it. It was a good thing. How do you see yourself in the future? What are your goals?

1
0:04:13
I don't want to look ahead too much, because goals change. My goal in 12th was different, now it's different. Now the goal is just to get a placement and leave. I can only say that I have to leave the placement. I don't have any pain. I know I will lose something. I can only say that I have to leave the placement.

1
0:04:45
What about the cat? Do you think you will be able to do MPA? I used to think about it but it was risky. I would have lost everything if I had not been in the placement. When do you get stressed? I get stressed when I have to do the household chores. I get stressed when I have to do the academic work.

1
0:05:00
I get stressed when I have to sit in the EBT. I don't have any other stress. How do you deal with it? I give credit to my brother-in-law. I will give him credit for that. He is very supportive. If he is not supportive, then there is no one to look after him.

1
0:05:16
I tell him everything. He is supportive. We discuss everything and then we implement the outcome. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye.
