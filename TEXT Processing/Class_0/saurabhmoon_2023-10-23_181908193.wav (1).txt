Smart work or hard work?

4

Smart work.

3
0:04:20
Why is that?

1
0:04:21
Sir, hard work is not a bad thing. If we talk about hard work, the people who work on the roadside are hard workers. And the people who manage the company, they don't do hard work, they do smart work. They manage the whole company. If they do hard work, if they work in the company, then the whole company will be managed in smart work. So I think that instead of hard work, smart work is better.
