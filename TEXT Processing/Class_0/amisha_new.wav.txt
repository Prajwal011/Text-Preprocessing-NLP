1
0:00:14

5
0:00:26
So, what is the best part

2
0:00:28
I don't feel like I'm a student, I'm a student of the sun

1
0:00:30
So what is the best part of engineering? I met my engineering friends, the crowd After the lockdown, we started socializing outside So there were some changes in life, good and bad I feel there is a growth in me because of my personality and engineering.

What is your favourite subject?

1
0:00:58
In engineering?

7
0:01:00
No, just in general.

3
0:01:02
History.

1
0:01:03
What do you like in history? I like medieval history and ancient Indian history.

2
0:01:10
What is the significance of that?

1
0:01:14
Significance means, it is a proud feeling that ancient India was a modern society. When the rest of the world was running, India was running. In ancient India, we had many advanced technologies. Like in Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas, there is a mention of a plane, like a flying object. And there are many such modern technologies that are mentioned in Upanishads and Puranas. It is very interesting and we don't know where it will go in the flow of time.

And when Naganda burnt the Takshashila, the university was burning for three months. And it was the first international university where students from all over the world were studying there. They were studying astrophysics, physics, history, economics, they were studying everything. Even science.

1
0:02:15
And the traders from China were saying that even the Dwarapal was more knowledgeable than them. Science, astronomy, very developed. So that is very interesting.

2
0:02:28
So you are from a small village, right? Yes.

3
0:02:31
So how do you feel living here?

1
0:02:33
Sometimes it's good, but sometimes it's very bad. Because there is no comfort here. And we are students, so we can't manage. We can't be active in the household, and not even in college. I was always on the floor, I had to do the housework, study, complete my assignments. Everything was so overwhelming that I felt like I should let it go.

1
0:03:04
Sometimes I would get so down because of all the stress that sometimes it feels like I should give up.

2
0:03:11
But you have been out for 4 years now.

1
0:03:14
It's been a while. It's been a year since I came to Pune. We were at home for 2 years due to the lockdown. And I had an academic gap of 1 year. After 12th. So, total 3 years in home and then suddenly...

1
0:03:30
But overall, the experience was good.

2
0:03:32
Yes.

4
0:03:34
What do you feel now?

2
0:03:36
Now I am in a good phase.

7
0:03:39
Okay phase.

1
0:03:40
Do you like staying here?

7
0:03:42
Most of the time I don't.

3
0:03:44
Do you miss your home?

2
0:03:45
Yes, that too. But I miss privacy more.

1
0:03:48
Alone time.

2
0:03:50
Do you feel lonely?

1
0:03:52
Yes. Do you feel sad? I don't feel sad. I feel I prefer to be alone. I feel that I am happier in my space.

2
0:04:09
What is your nature?

1
0:04:11
I feel that my nature has changed a lot. When I was in school, I was kind, extrovert, I could connect with people, I had empathy. But now, as I have come to college, I noticed that my empathy and selfishness were getting worse. I noticed a lot of changes in my behaviour.

6
0:04:32
Why?

5
0:04:33
I don't know.

1
0:04:34
I spent a lot of time with myself in the last 3 years of lockdown. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't socialize much. I didn't have any emotional connection with other people. I was alone with my family. I didn't feel the sensation. How do you manage your appetite?

1
0:05:00
I don't get sleep. I sleep only at 6 in the morning. I don't get appetite. I need to eat.

4
0:05:14
Do you have any goals for the future? Yes, I have.

3
0:05:17
What do you want to do in future?

1
0:05:19
I don't have any specific ambition or goal in future. But when I see myself in future, I am well settled and I am taking care of my family. I dream of my future. I dream of my family. I dream of my future. I dream of my family.

1
0:05:44
I dream of my family. I dream of my family. I dream of my family.
