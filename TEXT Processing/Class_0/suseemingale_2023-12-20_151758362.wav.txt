1
0:01:08
sometimes I feel like I am just doing it because there is a lot of load I mean only one person will handle everything this section, that section how will I see the appearance of this section and that section be seen in front

1
0:01:17
how will the stage be seen and if the others are not there with you in the same batch then it will be even more difficult but the joy of winning the competition that is the thing

When I found such points that there are 3-4 options to choose from, where to go in life, where to go, this branch, that branch, so what happens is that we don't know the future, what will happen tomorrow, we don't know that, so that thing becomes very hard. So you have a problem with decision making.

I I have been in a lot of relationships. I have been in a lot of relationships. I have been in a lot of relationships. I I was happy then, but now I don't feel like enjoying it as much.

0:03:46
I had a love life with a girl and we had a good relationship but I was the reason for their separation So you didn't try to bind him again? I tried many times but that girl kept saying that she will meet me again I was a student of the same school. I was in the same class as her. I was in the same class as her.

1
0:04:35
So that is why we need to think about it And do you feel that it is difficult for you to take a decision? Is there a reason for it? The reason is that we have to balance our own needs and the needs of our family balance What is your scenario, political or social? Do you have any importance? Or religious or non-religious?

We have been learning since childhood that people were hunters and gatherers. They killed animals and ate them.

1
0:05:47
They did not know who was God. They just ate meat and mutton every day. So how did people suddenly get the idea that

2
0:06:01
we should keep a person who should understand.

1
0:06:05
to and the rest of the people remained in the shadows. Because of that, all the unreligious people became religious, but they also became unreligious. Because of those people, they became unreligious. So, equality did not remain maintained.

1
0:06:41
Yes, equality did not remain maintained, because then the society became a class. The society became a class. Because of that, one society went down more, and one society went up more. the world.
