So you have exams? Yes, I have my unit tests, then I have submissions and practicals. Any stress? I don't have any risk, but I feel a little because I don't have attendance. But I don't feel anything now because I was worried about the second year. I was worried about submissions, that they have come, they have gone.

I was worried about the teachers, but now I don't feel anything. I am used to it, I learn things, I talk to the teachers, it's okay. You are used to it?

2

Yes, I am used to it. I feel like I am a home generalist. What do you think? What do you think is the most common student?

In the current situation, I think there is a lack of enthusiasm. What do you think? I think that there is a lack of enthusiasm. I have been studying for a long time now, but I have not found anything new. Everyone is the same, only few people change, and few do not. And I can say that we are developing.

What do you want to do for SSU? I want to continue my studies. I don't want to make any decision. I don't want to make any decision. I don't want to make any decision. I just want to continue my studies.

I don't want to make any decision. I don't want to make any decision. I just want to continue my studies. I don't want to get involved in studies. I did not like it. My parents were not happy with me. I wanted to do something.

So I did not study. But when I was in 11th grade, I could study well. I thought I would have a good future. I would get a good college. What is your future plan? I tried NDA but it didn't work. I tried SSB but it didn't work.

I tried English but it didn't work. I didn't know if CDS was there. I didn't use NDA. I tried JEE but it didn't try. I found out a few days later. I was looking for a CDS, but I couldn't get the fees for classes.

1
0:03:25
I tried for that. I focused on the placement of my students. I could have done online, but not that much. But we need to have a complete break. And we have to try to do both. So, placement college and CDS.

1
0:03:50
We have to complete the CDS. And I have a small dropout in English. Some students try to do it. His English was a little poor So, he tried to teach me English He could only teach me

1
0:04:08
the exam questions He could only study those But I had to try the English too Plus placement And my language was not complete

1
0:04:20
I was not able to pay the fees and get admission for classes. But I thought that my life is in this. I have a roommate who said that when you are placed, you should be alone. I said, I don't want to be placed alone. and then you can show the placement and clearly focus on the CDS. So, if you have a placement that is not needed,

1
0:04:56
and if you have completed the final year, then you can see if it is needed or not. I think there is a last chance for the exam after the final year. So, you can do that. Very good. You have good ambition. I want to find out what I want to do.
