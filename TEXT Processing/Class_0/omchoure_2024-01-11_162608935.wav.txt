I have completed my final year in Mechanical. Ok.

2
0:00:08
What do you like in Mechanical?

1
0:00:10
I have taken Mechanical because I like it a lot. I could have found a better field if I had good marks. But I was more interested in Mechanical. So I took Mechanical. I have done mechanical engineering in summer mechatronics. I have also done many projects in electronics.

I have also put up patents. I have done mechanical engineering in summer mechatronics.

2
0:00:41
What projects have you done?

1
0:00:44
I have done almost everything from basics. I have done so much that I have forgotten how much I have done.

2
0:00:52
Is there any business?

1
0:00:54
No, there is no business. I have done a few things and I have put it here and there. I have come to the point where I have to do it. So, I have come to this. There is no business.

2
0:01:08
What is your future plan?

1
0:01:11
I have a few patents on my name. My family members told me to go to the civil service because my father was also in the police force. But I told them that I want to go to Mechatronics and that I know a good engineer. So, you are going to do post-graduation?

2
0:01:32
Yes, post-graduation. So, you just want a degree and you want to join the company?

1
0:01:38
No, no. Post graduation.

0:01:40
So what are you preparing for that?

1
0:01:42
I am preparing for GATE.

2
0:01:43
You have started preparing for GATE?

5
0:01:44
Yes.

2
0:01:45
Okay. And other than academics, what do you like?

1
0:01:50
Other than academics, I am very interested in building projects. Like, I have put automation in my house. So everything is automatic in my house. Now, I don't have anyone in my house. Everyone has gone to the village. So now my phone has the status of the entire house. The door is locked, when I open it, my phone is directly on the screen.

1
0:02:08
I can turn off the lights from here. Everything is done automatically. I am more interested in that.

2
0:02:13
And how is your friend circle?

1
0:02:15
I don't like to stay with people. I am a bit of an introvert. I have a couple of friends. I have only two school friends. I like to stay with them. I don't like to socialize.

2
0:02:28
So you don't feel lonely?

1
0:02:30
No, not till now.

2
0:02:32
So you enjoy your company more than others?

4
0:02:35
Yes.

2
0:02:36
What makes you happy in the morning? Except making videos.

1
0:02:42
Except that, our school group, sometimes they go, it's good to be an extrovert.

2
0:03:00
I was feeling that my mother should come. As she started talking, I started moving away.

1
0:03:06
I was feeling that way from my relatives and friends. Is there a reason for this? No, I am not moving away. Earlier, everyone used to come and it was fun. Now, I feel a little irritated. I have grown up and I feel a little irritated.

2
0:03:22
Do you keep asking the same questions?

1
0:03:24
No. No, nothing like that? I

2
0:03:46
I think I was more of a mechanical placement. That's the only thing. Nothing else?

1
0:03:52
Nothing else. So, apart from academics and studies, what other things were not as important to you? I have never given importance to anything. I only have my family members who are important to me. My mom, dad, sister, that's it.

1
0:04:05
No one else. What do you like? How do you spend your family time? Family time... When I go home, my sister is a doctor. So, when my sister comes, we all stay together at home.

1
0:04:33
Then we play cards or something. Or we go out. Okay. Solid. Okay. Solid.
