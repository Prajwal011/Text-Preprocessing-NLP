4
0:00:31
What are you looking for in future?

I have a job in IT, I have an ENBC branch

1
0:00:35
but I will work in IT I will start in 3-4 years and after that I will practice spirituality What is spirituality practice? What is spirituality practice? Spirituality practice is the practice of achieving what you have said in school.

1
0:00:53
What did you say? Going back to the body. Ok.

3
0:00:59
You said there is another way to achieve it.

1
0:01:02
Yes. Actually, I will tell you the principle. One Supreme is there and we are the servants. So we have to merge... There are so many types of liberation, but we have to achieve the supreme one. We have to go to the spiritual world and serve the Lord,

1
0:01:25
serve the Supreme. So, for this, for Kali Yuga, there are scriptures. So, for Kali Yuga, the scriptures that are told, there are four ages, Satyug, Krita Yug, Daparig,

1
0:01:38
so for Kali Yuga, there are also Karigram, Sankirtan, I practice daily. How many rounds?

6
0:01:42
16 rounds.

1
0:01:43
What do you think about mental health?

3
0:01:44
Mental health was there before.

4
0:01:45
It was there in the past.

1
0:01:46
It was there in the future.

2
0:01:47
But when we started to think about it, it was a very good thing. I think it is a good thing. I think it is a good thing.

3
0:01:50
I think it is a good thing.

1
0:02:09
what to do in the future, but at that time, we were in the ignorance. There was something unknown. And whenever, in any situation,

1
0:02:23
like when there is darkness, or when there is light, that happens. So, whenever, I am not saying that there is complete ignorance, but there is a little source,

1
0:02:30
or a little glimpse, a little knowledge is obtained. The thing called depression is gone. I have heard the word clarity in the word, so I don't need to worry. So you are fearless now?

3
0:02:50
Yes, I am fearless now. Because we are so.

4
0:02:53
Why?

5
0:02:55
Why do we ask about the body?

1
0:02:58
Because the body is the source of energy and the mind is the source of energy.

4
0:03:02
Ok.

1
0:03:04
I will dedicate my life to serve society. Actually, there are many ways, but we have to go to the supreme way. There are many ways, like social workers, who are hungry and need to eat. or the hungry ones, or the people who have foundations, or the people who have food, clothing, etc. But the highest we can give is absolute truth with the knowledge.

1
0:03:46
What is your routine? I wake up at 3.50am, I do the chanting for 4.20pm, I do the prayers for 10 minutes, I do 16 rounds, and it takes me 8 minutes per round, so 2 hours. I do the Mangala Aarti at 6.30pm, so that takes me 30 minutes, It takes half an hour, from 7 to 8. I take spiritual classes, recording classes.
