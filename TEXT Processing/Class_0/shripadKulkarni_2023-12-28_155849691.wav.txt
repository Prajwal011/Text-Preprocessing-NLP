Hello, how are you?

3
0:00:02
I am fine. What are you doing now?

2
0:00:04
I am doing art circle.

1
0:00:05
What do you do in art circle? I compose music, play drums and sing.

2
0:00:11
Till when did you compose music?

1
0:00:14
It was a comedy genre. I was from a village and an elderly person from Dalit community. There was a short story on the background of the song. I had to make a song on that.

2
0:00:30
Are you passionate or you do it just because you like it?

1
0:00:36
I am passionate.

2
0:00:38
What is your future plan? Do you want to go into music or engineering?

1
0:00:43
Actually, my father wanted me to become an engineer, just like the society does. I wanted to be like the other people, who are working in the fields of art. I am the only one in my family who is doing education. So I chose engineering. Obviously, I was a top student in school, so I wanted to do it. But I have been interested in music since childhood.

1
0:01:15
I have not studied it, but I am interested.

2
0:01:18
Do you want to use civil engineering?

1
0:01:21
Nothing specific. I have a brother who is doing well in this field. I have been watching him since childhood. I felt a little impact. The way he speaks, the way he listens to music was very attractive

1
0:01:40
and I had this feeling since childhood that I should become something big or I should become a big official or I should become a big official

2
0:01:48
So you wanted to become a government official or a private sector official? Government So you started preparing for it?

1
0:01:56
Yes, I started preparing but I was not sure if there was anyone in my batch who was interested in music. And they said that I would have to hire someone from outside to do music. So I didn't like that personally. I have a year's experience.

1
0:02:12
So what should I do there to get people to talk to me? Or in future if I tell someone that I was here for music, I didn't like that. I didn't want to tell anyone that I was here. Because I didn't get the opportunity to study where I wanted to.

2
0:02:28
Do you think your studies and studies are hampering your studies?

1
0:02:32
Yes, I thought about it at one point, but when I decided to do this, I thought it's fine. If I get into this, I will complete it. Which field or department do you like the most in Civil Engineering? Actually, I have not studied much, I am only studying for exams. I am more interested in non-technical exams. So you are doing MPSC?

1
0:02:59
I am not doing it, but I am interested in history and politics.

2
0:03:06
What are your thoughts on what you have done so far? What are your thoughts on politics and history?

1
0:03:15
History is shown from different angles. First of all, Bakhar is written by us. So, those who want to stay in a king's court, they have to tell about the king. The history of the Mughals is not good, they were not good or they were torturing. Many people say that.

1
0:03:49
But Akbar was a king who was praised for his good qualities. And some historians say that Akbar was not a good king. I think we should learn from history. In India, when we had caste system, or different people were divided. Actually, they were not divided.

1
0:04:14
I personally believe that 12 were called Baluchis and 18 were called Aluchis. Everyone had a different job, which was on their profession. If there was a navigator, he was given a job according to that. That system was very good, but the British used the system of the Fodawa kingdom and took over India.

1
0:04:38
So, it is interesting that if we want to invade a place, we should not use our brains. Shivaji Maharaj, I mean, many kings, In Mughal era, Aurangzeb had conquered the whole of India. But I personally feel that if you attack a state, it is okay. But if you make your own state and make it an ideal state,

1
0:05:05
which people still call that state after 300-350 years, then I feel that such things are more important. It is connected to the politics of today. The politics I like the most are the Atal Vihari Vajpayee. How should the opposition be? This is also a good example.

1
0:05:24
How should the Satyamudra's party work? He had a deal with Pakistan. He had a deal with India to Pakistan. He attacked and then he also responded. India should be able to do this in the time of the British. I like such political people.

1
0:05:46
But it is not the case now. If you look at the environment in Maharashtra, what people can do for the truth, that is very bad. And the impact is that socially people are not alert. For example, now the Marathi Reservations Church,

1
0:06:04
many people are asking for reservations. People still don't understand why they need reservations.

2
0:06:11
Why are they given?

1
0:06:13
Because people who are socially backward, not economically, because everyone has been given a pension on an economic basis. People who are socially backward, they have been given reservations to up their social status. The Ambedkar's reservation was for 10 years, but they kept it for their own selfish reasons. In the Maratha society and other societies, people think that they are working in the field and that the policy is bad.

1
0:06:54
But if you look at the reservation process, they should be declared backward and then given a reservation. This has a lot of political impact because people do not understand that. So these things have a bigger impact on the people.

2
0:07:16
What is the most joyful thing in your life? What makes you happy?

1
0:07:22
I like playing cricket, I like singing. When I go home with my parents, we sit together and talk. The subject would be positive and that would be a good time. I was in class 9th and a girl proposed to me. I was a bit stuck in that decision because I was very idealistic.

1
0:08:00
Ideally, it's a different thing. So, after that, we started talking to each other. I was a normal student, average. Not as smart as I am. But, the way that girl came into my life, she set a different example.

1
0:08:18
She was a topper, so she wanted to promote me to study, how to be the best among 4 people I have learnt a lot of things and I have been told by my teachers I have a question for you In home or in education, they say that you should study I didn't get any impact then but my favourite person, she says yes, I say yes.

1
0:08:52
When she says no, I say no. So, that changes.

2
0:08:56
I like that.

1
0:08:58
So, is she still there? No, actually, the family she was in was a big family. A joint family. If you see, it's everywhere. If you see in Petit,

1
0:09:10
you'll see a lot of people from the society. If you see in Kund, you'll see a lot of people from the society. and if you look at the Kondwala, there are many special people there. In that part, the costumers are more. I felt that it was not appropriate.

1
0:09:28
She and my family had a good relationship. It was good if it was a family. I felt it was not appropriate. So I decided to take a pause for a year. I didn't go for her sake. I had a little selfishness in that.

1
0:09:44
But that was later. I didn't like her. I didn't know what she was doing. I didn't like her anger. I was alone for a year or two. I liked to be alone.

1
0:09:56
For a year or two. So, when I came to Pune, I had some friends and joined the section.

2
0:10:08
What was the most painful thing you have experienced in your life?

1
0:10:13
The most painful thing was... That you are not in her life. Yes, when a person is so good to us...

2
0:10:19
I was young then, I didn't know.

1
0:10:21
I was young then, I didn't know. I was young then, I didn't know. I was young then, I didn't know how to handle such things. I don't know how to handle music. I don't know how to handle drums. I am not that perfect in singing. But I get stuck in such things.

1
0:11:03
I don't know how to handle it. I just follow it. And then I get satisfied.

2
0:11:11
Why do you feel that your future is not good? Or you have mentioned that you don't have a good feeling about your future?

1
0:11:20
I have more faith in the present than in a good feeling. If I do things well now, I will have a good future. I don't think much about the future. I don't think much about the future.
