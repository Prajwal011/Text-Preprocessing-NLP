I'm the bestie, right?

1
0:00:07
I'm fine.

3
0:00:08
What are you doing right now?

1
0:00:11
I'm getting ready for the test.

2
0:00:14
How was it? How was your college four years?

1
0:00:18
I went home for two years. And the rest was here. It was fine.

2
0:00:23
You're not from the city? No. So how does it feel to be a handmaid?

1
0:00:29
It feels good, a little bit of independence and freedom It's not like I don't have a home, but it's good

2
0:00:36
But it doesn't feel like you are away from home?

10
0:00:40
It feels a lot

2
0:00:42
Do you miss your home?

1
0:00:44
When I get to know about my parents' age and their illness, I feel a little bit sad I have a younger brother, he can't handle it all. My mother had a different life. I don't remember, my mother needs me. I think this is the point where I want to stay away from it.

2
0:01:06
Do you work here or do you go to work?

1
0:01:09
Both. But mostly here. If I settle here, I will be here for the company placement. I haven't developed as much as I did in Varadha. What do you want to do in future?

9
0:01:23
What is your vision?

2
0:01:24
I want to go into powerlifting.

1
0:01:29
I am still confused right now. Should I make a career in that or not. I am preparing for the placement but still I am still considering this point.

2
0:01:47
What is powerlifting?

1
0:01:49
In powerlifting there are three parts, squats, deadlift and bench press. The more you lift, the more you get the score.

2
0:01:58
Have you ever practiced for that?

1
0:02:01
Yes, I have been doing gym since 2 years. I do see that I have potential. Recently I played in a college competition. It was 2 months ago that I joined the gym. I was thinking of going to the gym competition. I got a little confident. I didn't get tired.

1
0:02:24
I have never prepared for it. Powerlifting and gym is completely different. So, due to silly rules, I got a new lift. They qualified me for deadlift.

3
0:02:39
So, this is what I did.

8
0:02:41
Do you have a scope for it?

1
0:02:43
Yes, I have an opportunity. But, I am just working on it.

3
0:02:52
How is the experience here?

2
0:02:54
Like, living here, eating here, adjustment? Life is good. I am living my life.

1
0:03:02
I don't have any control over my life.

3
0:03:06
Do you feel the hectic schedule?

1
0:03:08
Do you feel the burden? No, I don't like it.

7
0:03:12
You don't like it?

2
0:03:14
If the day is fixed, it is good.

1
0:03:16
But sometimes,

6
0:03:18
I feel better when I am alone.

1
0:03:20
When I am alone. Do you feel lonely here? Or is there no one to talk to? Sometimes, I feel like it when we have more experience. But it's okay. Experience makes us more comfortable with ourselves.

2
0:03:50
How do you cope?

1
0:03:52
I cope like...

3
0:03:55
I have self-confidence that I will be good at learning.

1
0:03:58
Very good.

2
0:04:03
What do you think is important in student life? Student life is one of the best years in life.

1
0:04:12
I like to be a student only. You get to learn a lot. You can explore a lot of new things. Which you can't do in a profession. So this is only a case that you can explore a lot and you can get to know yourself.

1
0:04:33
That's it. That's why I think student life is so important and you shouldn't waste it.

2
0:04:41
What are the challenges of student life?

1
0:04:46
I feel that people are depressed. I live in a room of four people and I feel that my environment is very depressed. Sometimes, should I take names? Recently, you just have a daughter. She is my roommate. I feel that she is too depressed.

1
0:05:13
I just feel like she's too good as like, you know. And then, the environment that we are in, we get affected by it. So, I was wondering why we should ask for a solution to this. Like, if the environment is like this, how should we... I mean, we are doing it, right? We motivate, but...

5
0:05:29
But it gets influenced.

3
0:05:30
Yes, yes.

1
0:05:31
Environment matters a lot for them.

3
0:05:33
Yes, yes.

2
0:05:34
So, how do we get ourselves out of that situation? How do we balance it out or we have to go back to the point where we don't have any effect on the other person like someone has to come and work up for us that we are getting influenced by that thing

2
0:05:46
I do get influenced by things

1
0:05:48
but I don't have control on myself you are manageable

2
0:05:52
yes

3
0:05:54
have you ever been in an overwhelming situation?

2
0:05:56
yes

1
0:05:58
there is a phase like I do share if I get a comfortable person. It's not like I'm going to keep you in my house. Once the phase is gone, I will answer you.

2
0:06:18
So, there's a menstrual period?

1
0:06:21
Yes, I had it.

2
0:06:26
Was it a good time or not?

1
0:06:28
It was good, but I don't remember it that well.

2
0:06:32
Before the menstrual period or after?

1
0:06:35
Yes, before the menstrual period, I used to have it. I used to have mood swings, I used to get tensed. I used to get tensed even at night. I used to get sleepy.

3
0:06:48
I am not 100%

2
0:06:50
I do feel that I have potential but I don't have interest I was at my child's age

1
0:06:56
Actually, I wanted to study CDS. I took engineering as my major. I was not sure about life in CDS, but I thought I would settle down and finish my studies. Now I feel that I can do anything I want. I don't want to be a bad person, but I want to show everything but still... Passion?

1
0:07:40
Yes, passion. I love it. Uniforms, attraction and all that. Still now I am thinking to prepare on it. I have to prepare for the CDS exam. I will just...

4
0:07:52
Everything.

3
0:07:53
Okay.

1
0:07:54

2
0:07:55
