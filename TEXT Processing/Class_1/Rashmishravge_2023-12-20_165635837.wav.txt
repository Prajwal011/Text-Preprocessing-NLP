0:00:06
I am practicing for the art circle of Firozia Karandak. I come here daily in February. What do you do? I play harmonium in music. I also dance, sing, play harmonium, play guitar, piano and also paint. I have been learning Bharatnatyam since I was 12 years old.

1
0:00:34
I have been learning classical singing since I was 6 years old.

2
0:00:46
What do you think about the classical music?

1
0:00:52
They have their own unique and interesting aspects. I think classical music is better because you can explore everything. It is a base. It is a base of music. You can compose music, play any instrument. Who is your favorite singer? My favorite singer is Shreya Bhushan.

2
0:01:22
And classical singer?

1
0:01:24
Classical singer is Kaushiki Chakraborty. What is your favorite recipe of her that you like and you get happiness from? I like the movies of Ragh and Maithili. Ragh Multani and Shuddha Kalyan's movies are my favourites. How is your academic studies? It is going well. I can manage both.

1
0:01:56
My CGP is above 9. I don't have any problem with that.

2
0:02:02
So you both manage well. Yes. You don't have any problem.

4
0:02:06
No.

2
0:02:07
So your biotech and your hobby, how do you manage in both? Manage in the sense, you can learn the hobby. Singing is a different form. And technology is a different form.

1
0:02:18
I mean, I have liked singing and dancing since childhood. But then on 11th and 12th, I was smart and I had good marks, but I was not able to do medical. I was not able to focus on other things. So I chose Biotech. This is the same college, in Sinhagad. I was focused on this course and I wanted to do my Masters in this field.

1
0:02:45
I wanted to go in the research field. I have been interested in biotech for the past 4 years. I do want to study, but I don't have the same intensity and interest as before.

2
0:03:03
Is there a field in biotech that you like a lot?

1
0:03:07
Or if you get a chance in the future, would you like to do something in genomics. But I don't like it now.

2
0:03:26
What about your friends?

1
0:03:29
What do you do with them? We got admitted to college during the lockdown and we went to college for 2-1.5 years and then we started college I have friends, 2 of my friends are very good but we don't have a strong bonding

1
0:03:55
I have friends who are very close to me I also have a friend who is my best friend. So we didn't have a bonding. So we didn't go out much. We went to Khadappas and we made movie plans once or twice.

1
0:04:13
We made very few plans. We didn't go out like we used to in college. And we had a biotech. So we had a plan to go to class, but everyone cancelled it.

2
0:04:27
and then cancel it all and end up with a cancellation Is there anything that you find difficult or that you should avoid?

1
0:04:37
Both But mostly I like singing and dancing and my grandma didn't like it at all when I was a kid, I used to hide my books in my bed. I used to do that a lot. My mother used to tell me to learn, so she put me in a class. But I used to tell her, don't do anything good, you won't get good grades.

1
0:05:09
I think that had a big impact on me when I was young. I feel I am very insecure. I feel I don't even know what I am doing. I used to feel this way when I was in college. But now, after 2-3 years, I have started to understand that I am not good enough. But I still feel that I am not good enough. So you are still in this mood?

2
0:05:40
Yes

1
0:05:41
And what do you feel guilty about? Not doing enough. I feel that I can improve in many things, but I can't do that.

2
0:05:53
What do you feel is your weakness?

1
0:05:56
I am insecure. I don't have the confidence to be successful. I don't have the leadership to do it. I have to do it. I have to do it in the field of dance and music. In general, I have to do it even if I go to a corporate. I don't have that much of knowledge.

1
0:06:22
Do you try to do it? I was in a tight circle, I was mostly there for them, I am a senior here. But I don't feel like a senior, so I try to do what I am told. And what physical problems do you have?

2
0:06:43
In general, I am very weak and healthy.

1
0:06:49
I have a lot of problems with my health. I have PCOD but it is manageable. I used to have a lot of problems and I used to have weight problems. I used to have small and big problems. Last week I had an inflammation in my eyes. It was like a Ranganwadi. Before that I used to have some problems.

1
0:07:14
I have heard that there is something going on in my ears, I have a lot of earwax, I have to go to the doctor for that, it is not good if I catch a cold. I have got used to it now, but something or the other is continuously coming out, like there is a pain in my stomach. What is your opinion on the news. I am a very sensitive person. I think a lot about the future of the country. I overthink the global warming.

1
0:07:54
I don't read anything on the news. I have only one fear in politics. It is the caste certificate. My father also said that we have income but not the caste. I was admitted to OBC but I had not got the caste certificate. My father also said that we have income but not the caste.

1
0:08:19
I was admitted to OBC but I had not got the caste. Many people of lower caste have bad marks and they earn well. They have good financial conditions. But just because they have caste, they get good admission in colleges. I was trying to get admission in the same college for my mother. But my mother's name was in the open.

1
0:08:44
So, I would suggest that you should give them the marks and reduce their fees. At least, they should be smart and not lose anything. So, give them admission and reduce their fees. And check their financial status. But, it happens that many people take advantage of this. They get good marks and good income.

1
0:09:06
But, they get good admission in college. Their fees are also low. We have to pay for all this.

3
0:09:13
That's how it is. That's how it is.

2
0:09:15
I am not sure.
