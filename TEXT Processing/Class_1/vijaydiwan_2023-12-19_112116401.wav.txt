There are different types of it. Some are imaginary, some are real and some are made by the mind.

2
0:01:25
Can you give some examples?

1
0:01:27
of What do you think about your future? I want a stable income source and I want to travel the world and see different things.

2
0:02:01
How do you see your future?

1
0:02:04
I don't have any specific goal. I want to enjoy my life and see new things. I don't want to be limited to one thing. I want to do this thing for the rest of my life. I want to see new things. I have met only one life and I feel happy that I have done something new.

2
0:03:11
What is the one thing that gives you trouble in life?

1
0:03:19
I don't like anything that is tied up in me. I don't like anything that is broken or tied up. I felt that I should start something new. But I won't be able to do it if I am stuck in something. For example, it is said that some people get married in the early age and they don't get any exposure. In our system, girls get married early and they don't get any exposure.

1
0:04:03
I don't want to see any kind of hatred. I don't like to see any kind of hatred. I don't like to see any kind of hatred.

2
0:04:15
Do you have any kind of hatred in your life?

1
0:04:18
In general, I live in a society where the girls are not treated well. I have a wish that I would like to do this as much as possible. I would like to explore the world as a single person. And maybe when I grow up, I will be able to do this. I wanted to be alone and explore the world. And maybe when I was satisfied, I made a bucket list of things that I wanted to do before I died.

1
0:05:02
And after that I did the rest of the things.

2
0:05:07
What do you think about the society?

1
0:05:10
The society reacts according to how we behave.

2
0:05:16
I react to what I feel.

1
0:05:20
Do you have any plans for the society? I want to be a DRDO or a Sarpanch. I had a Sarpanch in my childhood. that at a particular time, after 40-45 years, when I won't be able to travel much physically, my list of things I have told you will be fulfilled. At that time, I want to do this for the development of my village.

2
0:05:54
What thing is it that you feel is dissatisfying or boring?

1
0:05:59
I am a little disappointed that I was not able to tell you about my satisfaction. I am 21 years old now, but I have to look at the skill set. I see that as a risk.

2
0:06:37
What do you try to achieve?

1
0:06:39
I am still focusing on my studies. I am doing this for my studies. I want to do this skill. I am not that much... I don't have any specific plan.

2
0:06:54
I don't know what will be the source of income. So you haven't decided yet?

1
0:07:00
You want to go to IIT or CORE? You haven't decided anything like that? I want to go to CORE, but I don't have that much knowledge. I think practically, I want to go, but the lifestyle I am doing now, I do this. And the hard work that I put in, and the environment that I have to study in, I don't think I can crack that now.

1
0:07:31
And how do you feel your interest in people is decreasing? How is your friend circle? I try to be myself and not look at others as a threat. I will work hard for the people who are close to me.

2
0:07:53
Why do you do this? Why do you trust less people?

1
0:07:57
It's not about trust. I don't like to interfere in other people's affairs As long as I don't get affected by it If I don't need it, I don't care

2
0:08:12
So you don't like it when people are around you?

1
0:08:15
Yes, I was told this during the lockdown I enjoyed a lot during the lockdown. I was alone in the hostel. I like to be alone. I don't feel scared.

2
0:08:36
You enjoy yourself.

1
0:08:38
I don't feel like people are boring. I feel happy when I am alone. I don't feel like people are boring. I feel happy when I am alone. Thank you.
