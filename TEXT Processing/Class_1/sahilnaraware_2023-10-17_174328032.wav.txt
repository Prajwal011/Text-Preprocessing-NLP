What do you think, sir? It's been more than a year since the session.

Yes.

1

It's been more than a year. Sir, what issues should we focus on? On issues?

Yes.

The issues that students face, they are the same. The anxiety, the stress. I am stressed out by what the other guys are doing. I have a son in my room, he will get his CS. But he doesn't have a job. He is also stressed out. He doesn't talk to anyone. That's what I want. How to reduce stress on the kids. What do you do? When you are stressed, you listen to music. I listen to music. I have a playlist. I just listen to it. Do you have a name for it? No, I don't. But that's what I want. I have no support. How did you feel when you heard that you are going to be a famous actor? I was an average student till 10th standard. I had good friends in 11th and 12th. I had good friends and I was the first in my division. I had a 120-points batch. I was in the J-W-E division. I had good marks in my class. I gave my first attempt. I got only 35 percent. I started to get good marks in my home. I got a few less. I got demotivated. I gave my second attempt. I was demotivated. I thought I would be fine. I got CET and got 88% in CET. I felt I could do something. I was in JW and I thought I would be fine. I was good at Polish too. What did you learn in these 4 years? If you do something with determination, it will happen. When I came home in the first year, I used to think that I should start coding. Now that we are in lockdown, I don't have that much capacity. I have online papers, so I can copy. But I didn't start. But when I came here, I felt the need and started, it started to understand it. I could read the code, I could understand the logic. I could see that I could do it.

2
0:05:22
I see. What advice would you give to the students?

4
0:05:25
Advice?

1
0:05:26
Yes. I would tell them to do what they want to do. Do it at the right time. We did not do anything in the first year. And now we regret that we should have done it earlier.

3
0:05:39
What do you mean?

1
0:05:40
I mean, coding, aptitude, we started it very late, like in the second sem of the third year. If we had done it earlier, it would have been easier.

2
0:05:49
Otherwise, you feel a lot of overburden? Overburden, assignments.
