If there is a scene, a horror effect or any other scene, the lights flicker. Then there is a mechanism of the lights, how to make them, how to run them, how to make them flicker on the spot for that time period, and to keep it stable. This is our work in short-talk. Do you like to do all this? Yes.

1
0:01:07
Or you have done it before. I like doing lights in my set. I have been doing it since my first year. I am in my third year now. I have been doing it since my first year. I like it. Is it good or is there anything else good? I can't specify what is good. If I like something, I feel like doing it. Suppose someone plays piano very well in front of me, I want to learn it and play it.

1
0:01:44
Or maybe I play guitar. I play guitar too. I learn it, but I get it. What else do you like? I like to travel a lot. I like to travel and sleep.

1
0:01:58
But I can't sleep. Where do you like to travel? Out of station. Anywhere. I don't like to travel. I like to travel.

What do you say? How do I say? Nature places. Yes, I like nature places. I like to go to spiritual places.

2
0:02:22
I like spiritual places,

1
0:02:24
but I like nature more. I mean, where I live, there is nature all around me. So I like to stay there or go to the jungle or camping. The school I went to, it was an entire army area. So there were a lot of trees and animals. So I have a habit of nature from the beginning.

1
0:02:47
That's why I like nature a lot. I am not saying that I am happy. I am not saying that I am happy. I am not saying that I am happy. I am not saying that I am happy. I am not saying that I am happy. I am not and if something happens, I like it or I feel happy and what made you sad? or you still have that feeling?

1
0:03:15
I can't say sad, I regret a little my uncle expired he called me to meet him but for some reasons, I was in a hurry I had to attend exams, boards were being laid I was busy with exams and boards.

1
0:03:36
I couldn't go because of some reasons. And after that, it just expired. We never met again. That was a very sad moment. You can call it regret. That's one side. Nothing else.

1
0:03:50
Why do you think you can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy? I am not sure if I can say this, but I have been through a lot. I have been through a lot. I have been through a lot. I have been through a lot. to

I was not expecting it. I was not expecting it. I was expecting it. I was expecting it. But still you said something. I realized it later. I told you something. I don't like it. Don't do it. If you are doing it, give me a consent. I will do it. I will prepare for it. But tell me after you do it. Or tell me and do it again. It has happened to me many times I have been friends with them for a long time. But now I don't know whether to trust someone or not.

1
0:05:20
So I have become a little bit like that. I used to be very shy before. I didn't have any school friends. But now I have become friends with the same age group. I don't feel like I am alone with them. I have friends here too, but not all of them are like me.

1
0:05:42
I have 100-200 friends in college, but I have only 5 friends who I can talk to and understand me. I have only 5 friends like that. Why do you think you are guilty of doing something wrong? No, my concept is different. I don't do anything wrong. I have decided that I will do internship later, but because of art circle, I am not getting that much attention in internship.

1
0:06:11
My internship will be ruined and I am not getting attention here. So, my decision is that I will do internship later and art circle now. Now, if there are any consequences of this, like something is getting ruined because of internship or something has happened here, then I will not be able to do this. to to

I can freely say anything to them. They can tell me anything. What is your political view, religious view, or any other view? Political in the sense, politics. I don't understand anything. They work for people,

1
0:07:40
not for their seats. We say seats, right? Or for money. We see that the government is passing so many bills, but they don't reach people. They disappear from the money.

1
0:07:52
I have no interest in that at all. In politics. I don't have interest and I don't like it. And... What else did you ask? Religious in the sense that it is religious and has scientific proof.

If my parents have told me not to do this or that or do this or that, then why should I do it? If I don't find a reason for it, then I don't do it. If my mother has told me not to go there. We have periods. Before, we were told not to go to the temple during periods. Why not? No one told me the reason. I didn't go because my mother didn't allow me to go.

1
0:08:38
But when I found out the reason, that the energy of the energy is down, the energy of the temple is low, the organs are affected, when I found out the reason, and I understood the reason,

1
0:08:51
I said I won't do it. I have to do it. I have to do it. I have to do it. I have to do it. to be a good person.
