Hello. How are you? I am fine, sir. What's going on? Nothing much. I am preparing for the placement. I am preparing for the D&D project.

6
0:00:18
Where?

1
0:00:19
D&D. D&D? Yes, sir. And I am preparing for the project. How is the experience? I am a direct second year sir. How was your experience?

1
0:00:33
It was good.

2
0:00:35
What do you mean by good? How did you get a good experience?

1
0:00:38
I met a lot of new people, new things, and met good friends. I have met good friends recently. Oh really?

5
0:00:48
Yes.

1
0:00:49
So, that's why I said everything was good.

3
0:00:52
Now, you are worried about such things?

1
0:00:55
Yes, now I don't take any risk. I think about it 10 times while doing something new. Whether to do it or not, what to do, etc. Like what? Like, what to do new? Sometimes I feel, do what we like.

1
0:01:16
Is it your career or other things? It's my career. Sometimes I feel like I have to take a certain path in my career. But I don't know how the market is right now. I have to take the first chance. I have to take the risk.

1
0:01:35
Before I used to do whatever I felt was right for me in my diploma. That was my best. Now I have completely left it. What is your favourite thing to do? My favourite thing is to learn new things. Nothing specific.

1
0:01:54
I like to search for the material I like. Or I like to look for the people I like a person, I will sit in front of him or if I meet a new person sometimes if I like a country, I will do everything for it from history to culture, everything

2
0:02:16
so in this period, tension, such things?

1
0:02:19
yes, a little tension, placement is tension, nothing else nothing else? placement is... yes, placement is...

2
0:02:29
Friendship is...

1
0:02:31
Friendship? I don't know where I found such friends. Earlier, I had such friends who were only there to do their work. Now, when I meet such people, I feel strange. I don't even call them by their names, but they are always behind me. Sometimes, we have a lot of arguments, but we are still together. Even if we have argued 2-3 times, we are still together.

1
0:02:55
Friendship is a new thing. It is different from home, but it is very alive.

3
0:03:02
So now you get over-thinking?

2
0:03:04
Yes, a lot.

1
0:03:05
Over-thinking is about that. I told you, sir. It is in placements. Over-thinking. So, I'm thinking. I get a lot of questions

1
0:03:15
So I just do it I do set the alarm but it gets me to sleep before the alarm rings

3
0:03:22
I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm

1
0:03:24
Sometimes even a minute before

4
0:03:26
How is the food?

1
0:03:28
The food used to be good before It used to be very filling But now Now it's not that good It's starting to decrease The food is good but

1
0:03:40
Now it's starting to decrease. I'm fine, but still, I don't feel like eating as much as I want. How do you feel now? Are you still feeling it? Yes, now I'm free.

1
0:03:50
Now I'm free, I don't feel anything. What are you going to do now? Now I'm going to join the carnival. The carnival is still going on. Today is the last day. I said, it's the fourth year,

1
0:03:59
I'll attend everything. It's the last year. Because a senior had told me that after that, I'll be able to do something.

3
0:04:06
That's what I'm doing.

2
0:04:07
Is it today?

1
0:04:08
