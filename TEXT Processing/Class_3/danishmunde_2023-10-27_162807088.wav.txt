Whichever thing I want to start, I have to push myself too much. I have to try a lot, then I'd wait. I procrastinate, I need to shut myself off and get it done. If there are assignments, lockdowns, research, which is needed to be submitted to college or anything, where professional relations are taken, then I have to shut myself off,

If I can share other's experiences, is it fine? to What coping strategies do you use? Gym What do you suggest to youngsters? Talk to your parents, talk to your friends

So one thing I do is, I recommend this to others, that most of the time you think that everyone judges you, my friends judge me, if I tell them something, they use it against me, they make excuses. So instead of that, find a person which is not in your circle, who is completely apart from your life,

1

and then tell them everything, just shut everything down, they won't judge you, they won't share anything, use anything against you. they won't judge you, they won't share anything, use anything against you. Find that kind of nurse.
