0:03:26
So I went against my family and took biotech. But I had a different expectation for the first year, when I realized that all the branches are the same and the syllabus is the same, and the bio background is the same, and what we like, where will it go wrong? I was very worried. But from that day, the whole first year, I was asked, why did I come here? Is there something wrong?

1
0:03:55
My family members are saying that I should become a doctor. So, I should become a doctor. So, in all these questions, my interest in studies also decreased. I was not interested in biotechnology. So I had to back out of two subjects. I was not used to studying, but it happened.
