I am a little bit scared.

1
0:01:22
I am scared of everything. Why do you feel that way? When I was little, I had three sisters. I was very sad. I gave birth to a girl. The doctor said that if I abort, she will die.

So I didn't abort. I gave birth to a girl. My father was very angry with me. He said, you will leave the house. I was the third child. He said, you will only give birth to a girl.

I had given my hand to everyone and had even divorced. I was eight years old. I still like him. I have been feeling scared since then. But you never blamed your mother, right? Until a year passed.

0:03:04
And then you returned home normally? After that, Papa doesn't talk like that. He doesn't talk to any of your sisters? to How important is your mother to you? Mother? For the household?

1
0:03:33
That's all. For the work of my father. And for his well-being. When did you start to care for your mother? I did care for my mother. I was very young, I didn't know anything.

1
0:03:57
But then, everything was fine. But the incident that happened, it had a big impact on me. What made you happy? My sister. What do you both do? I'm a little bit scared.

1
0:04:21
I'm a little bit scared. I'm a little bit scared. I have a lot of questions. Sometimes I get questions while answering them.

2
0:04:40
And I get my answers.

1
0:04:42
What do you think about the future? I had thought about it before. But my father always said, if you do well and become a doctor, it will be good. Otherwise, nothing will happen to you.

1
0:04:58
I was sick for a year. I don't know what happened. But from the moment I saw the answer, I had put the wrong answer. I didn't want to listen to him. I went against him. And I got an AC hug at college. So, since then, he doesn't talk to you? He does. He doesn't talk to me. He doesn't talk to you?

1
0:05:23
No. He doesn't talk to me? No. I got my B.C. in Harvard College. So, since then, they don't talk to you? They do. We have a normal conversation.

1
0:05:33
But, not like father and daughter. Why do you think you are not a good person? I don't know. I don't know if I get satisfaction or not. I think I deserve happiness in what I have. Do you try to get happiness or not?
