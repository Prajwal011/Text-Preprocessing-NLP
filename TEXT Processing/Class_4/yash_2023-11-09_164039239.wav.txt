How was your college?

1
0:00:06
I had a scene in the play, but I didn't get a detention. I got a sword. Did you feel any stress? I felt like I had done something wrong. How did you get a detention? I got attendance.

How many times did you study? 10% in Likshedkar You completed it in 3rd year? No, in 5th year I was preparing for placement for the competitive exams

1
0:00:36
I was preparing for that I got a little distracted here and then I went to Dengue So I was in attendance for the entire semester So you were in attendance for the entire semester How did you handle the long plus-day?

1
0:00:48
How did you handle the long plus-day? My wife stayed here I have a brother who lives in Mumbai, he is an ARBI student. If I had a brother, I would have been able to handle everything. What do you think is the most stressful period and then you have to get a placement

1
0:01:18
so what do you need for a placement? you need a character if you have that in you, you will be fine even if you don't get a job, you will be fine because there are a lot of boys who have good cgpa but still they don't get a placement

1

and those who have less cgpa, they get a placement. My personal view is that people who are not so famous, they have a doubt whether they are more famous in real life and whether they can compete with others. Maybe that is the dilemma. Because a confident person will never be as good as a smart person.

That's what I think so. So, personality development is very important. Yes, personality development. What do you want to learn from it? Body language. Your tone is very important while speaking.

1
0:02:14
It should be monotonous. I gave a mock interview, I got a lot of feedback. I started very well, but the tone was a little low. So, this is a good insight, a good tone. For this, extracurricular activities are the best way, or you can do your own personality development. So, are there any such provisions in our curriculum?

1
0:02:42
Yes, there are. College organizes many events. They encourage you, they give you the input. I have a lot of input in it. I don't have to take it personally.

0:02:57

You just had to try.

1
0:04:06
Yes, I had to try.

2
0:04:07
You did that. That's a good thing. How do you see yourself in the future?

1
0:04:13
I don't want to see myself in the future, because... goals change. My goal in 12th was different, now it's different. Now the goal is just to get a placement and leave. I can only say that I have to leave the placement. No, I don't have any pain.

1
0:04:37
I know that I will lose something. I can only say that I have to leave the placement. What about the cat? Do you think of doing a MPA? I used to think about it, but it was risky. I would have lost everything if I had left the placement.

1
0:04:52
When do you get stressed? I get stressed when I have to do the household chores. I get stressed when I have to do the academic work. I get stressed when I have to sit in the EBT. I don't have any other stress. How do you deal with it?

1

I give credit to my brother-in-law. I will give him a lot of credit for that. He is very supportive. If he is not supportive, then there is no one to look after him. I tell him everything. He is supportive. We discuss everything and then we implement the outcome. Okay.
